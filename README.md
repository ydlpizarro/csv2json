# csv2json
This project was created due to the need to convert a CSV spreadsheet of approximately 500MB, and I decided to put my knowledge of NodeJS into practice
----
----
## CSV File

- Put the csv file inside the file folder.

- The file used was taken from [Here](https://support.spatialkey.com/spatialkey-sample-csv-data/ "spatialkey-sample-csv-data")

- Change the values **global.fileNameCSV** and **global.fileNameJson** for the correct CSV and JSON paths
----
## RUN csv2json
- In the project's root folder you can run the following command
`$ npm run csv2json`
